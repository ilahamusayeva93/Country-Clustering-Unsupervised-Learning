### Country Categorization Using Socio-economic and Health Factors
## Overview
This project focuses on categorizing countries into different groups based on socio-economic and health factors. The dataset, named "country.csv," contains information about various countries, such as child mortality, exports, health spending, income, inflation, life expectancy, total fertility, and GDP per capita.

## Dataset Exploration
The initial exploration of the dataset involves checking for duplicate entries, handling missing values, and obtaining statistical summaries. The analysis includes examining missing values and a statistical summary of the dataset.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and extract principal components. The explained variance is visualized, and the number of principal components is determined.

## K-Means Clustering
K-Means clustering is employed to categorize countries based on the reduced principal components. The elbow method is used to find the optimal number of clusters, and the countries are grouped accordingly.

## Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is performed to create a dendrogram, providing insights into the hierarchical relationships between countries. The Agglomerative Clustering method is applied to categorize countries into clusters.

## Results
The results include visualizations of the K-Means clusters and the hierarchical dendrogram. The countries are categorized into different clusters based on socio-economic and health factors.

## Next Steps
Further analysis and interpretation of the cluster characteristics can be performed. Additionally, exploring the features contributing to the clustering results and refining the model could enhance the categorization accuracy.
